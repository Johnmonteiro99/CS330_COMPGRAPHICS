How do I approach designing software?
-What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
A: The ability to create a 3D scene by utilizing various shapes, textures, lighting, as well as other functions to bring the 3D scene to life. 

-What design process did you follow for your project work?
A: I chose a 2D picture of a real life environment and then recreated it as 3D scene. I used google advanced search to look for textures that would match the object as seen in the 2D photo, and used specific mateiral textures, and shaders to make the 3D scene look more realistic. 

-How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
A: If i choose a career path such as in the video game industry, i could utilize these design approach to create 3D scenes that enables video gamers to interact with. For example, i could recreate a 3D world that enables players to walk or perform any functions that is resembled of a real life scenario in a virtual world. 

-How do I approach developing programs?
A: I approach desining software by first understanding what the project is about and what kinds of outcomes the project is trying to achieve. The next steps would be to outline a plan for the development by creating 
documents, flowcharts, pseudocode, and other tools to ensure i have a step by step guide to complete the project from start to finish, implementing all necessary functions to run the software. 

-What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
A new development stratergy i used while working on my 3D scene was having a reference photo of the realistic 2D photo so that i could visually see in order to recreate the 3D scene that resembled the 2D scene as close as possible. Another stratergy was reading through the OpenGL guides whislt i was coding as a reference whenever i did not understand a particular function. 

-How did iteration factor into your development?
A: There were many objects within my develpment that used the same shapes multiple times, therefore utilizing the same code that was put into a function proved to be very useful.

-How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
A: This was the very first time i ever created a 3D scene, thus everything i learned throughout the milestones helped me complete the project, as i had no prior experience before this course. Every milestone resources helped me achieve the final scene in the project. From shading, texturing, lighting, these were all new to me, so understanding the course materials and codes that were already provided was neccessary for me to complete the project.

-How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
A: Computer science can help me in reaching my goals of becoming a software engineer in my pursuit of creating web applications that could help people around the world. Whether i choose to work on a program that is already on the market, or create something from scratch with my own ideas, learning the fundamentals skills of computer science will help me with these goals. 

-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
A: Computational graphics and visualizations has many uses today and will have many more in the future that we utilize on a day to day basis, therefore in my future educational pathways, if i choose to purue a field that utilizes comp graphics such as creating 3D map for future cars, the skills from this course will be of great help given that i have the fundamental skills of how 3D scene work. 

-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
A: As i mentioned before, i may pursue a career path in video game designing, therefore the knowledge and skills i've obtained in computational graphics and visualization will serve me in my understanding of the fundamentals that it takes to create 3D scenes that are often found in video games.
